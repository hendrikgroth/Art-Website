Hello, my name is Hendrik, I have taken 2 art classes so far; Drawing 1 and Ceramics 1. I love to travel and some of my art is inspired by those places I visit. My hobbies include playing video games and coding, which is why I decided to code this website myself instead of using Weebly, as a strongly dislike Weebly and I felt it would give me experience in something other than the usual WPF desktop applications I usually make. I have already created desktop applications used by thousands of people, so I plan to go to college and start making money doing something I enjoy.
